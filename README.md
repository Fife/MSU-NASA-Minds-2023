## Getting Started with ARGoS Simulator on an Ubuntu Machine:

1. Install ARGoS as per directions here https://www.argos-sim.info/core.php 

2. Clone the ARGoS-Simulations Repository and save it in a memorable place. 

3. Navigate to the repository using the terminal and run the command:

`argos3 -c  lua-only/examples/prototype-example.argos`

This will run the example simulation and also open the Lua editor where you can change the Robot's behaviour with a Lua Script.
